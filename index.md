## About me

<div style="float: right">
    <img src="{{ "/assets/me.png" | prepend: site.github.url }}" alt="This is me :D">
</div>

I like working with Computers, Operating Systems, Servers and building things. I studied in computer science at Hochschule Niederrhein, University of Applied Sciences in Germany.

When I'm not behind a computer (yes, this is possible, sometimes), I enjoy playing board games and mind puzzles. Also being outside and doing some hiking is an option.

This site is complete build with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). This blog is served by the awesome [uberspace.de](https://uberspace.de). Thanks, to Jekyll, no database and dynamic code is used on the server site. You can find the source code on [github](https://github.com/sangyye/website).
